        <h1>things i wish i knew when first using openutau</h1>
        <p>summer, 2024. being a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vocaloid">vocaloid</a> music and wanting
            to try my hand at using the software, the free
            alternative utau and its enhanced successor <a href="https://www.openutau.com/" target="_blank">openutau</a>
            made this very accessible. however, as a niche software,
            documentation and basic help tips are scattered, and i wished there was a straightforward resource for every
            question i had when first learning the program.</p>
        <p>time to do just that:</p>

        <details>
            <summary>what is openutau?</summary>
            <p>openutau is a free-to-use open-source <span class="highlight">vocal synthesis software</span>. it is
                based off of utau ("to sing"), created
                by ameya in 2008, which served as a free alternative to the commercial synth editor vocaloid (ever heard
                of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank">hatsune miku</a>?). while utau has
                seen little updates
                since its release, openutau, its unofficial successor,
                opened its first beta in 2021 and streamlined the general user-interface and user-experience to become
                more
                accessible.

            <summary>what is a vocal synth editor, and what's with all the characters?</summary>
            <p>vocal synthesis editors such as utau, openutau, and vocaloid allow users to input midi sequences and
                lyrics
                to have <span class="highlight">voicebanks</span>, which are databases of samples sung by a voice actor or a singer or <a
                    href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/138808" target="_blank">train engines</a>, sing melodies. since utau is
                open-source, all of the voices are created and distributed for free by a wide internet community with
                varying commercial use licenses. in the majority of cases, these voices are anthropomorphized into their
                own
                characters, complete with their own names, character designs, backstories, etc. divorced from their
                original
                voice actor or creator.</p>

        <h2>my favorite voicebanks</h2>
        <p>with openutau's voicebank library being entirely community-made and free to use, there's a massive variety of
            characters to choose from. openutau even has more language support than other commercial synths!<br>
            that said, the songs i gravitate towards when covering songs are usually <span class="highlight">japanese or
                english</span>, so voicebanks
            recorded in those languages appeal to me. here are some of my favorites:</p>

        <h3>japanese</h3>

        <div class="icon-section">
            <p><img src="assets/teto icon.bmp" class="icon" alt="icon of kasane teto"></p>
            <p><b>kasane teto</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>the one and only. her vocals are crunchy, and her english is nowhere near as smooth as
            her fancy commercial database for synthesizer v, but her sound collection is huge regardless, not to mention the nostalgic quality of her character and vocals.<br>

            <p><b>adachi rei</b></p>
        </div>

        <p>one of the most endearing and beloved vocal synth characters in the modern era. her
            vocals are <span class="highlight">entirely artificial</span>, being rendered in audacity and modified to
            sound like syllables. this
            results in vocals that are tinny, robotic, and borderline incomprehensible. and we love her for that! her
            original language of origin is japanese, but there have been some derivative databases made with her sample
            library to support other languages, including many options for english, <a
                href="https://utau.fandom.com/wiki/Rei_Adachi#Voicebank_distribution">which can be viewed on the utau

            <p><b>gekiyaku</b></p>
        </div>

        <p>she’s my favorite! gekiyaku has over ten voicebanks with different vocal styles and
            gimmicks; your mileage may vary depending on your needs and preferences, but they’re all high-quality enough
            to be worth trying out and keeping on your computer. her voice is strong and powerful in most of her vocal
            modes, making her great for metal, though her more soft-spoken voice colors lend themselves to other genres
            well. and she’s FREE?! how good is that?<br>

        <h3>english</h3>

            <p><img src="assets/hanami icon.jpg" alt="icon of hishino hanami" class="icon"></p>
            <p><b>hoshino hanami</b></p>
        </div>

        <p>compared to her japanese voicebank, her english voicebank is a bit limited. this is a
            constant for a lot of utau databases since japanese is much easier and beginner-friendly to record and
            configure. she only has one pitch (meaning higher vocal ranges will only distort her samples) and doesn’t
            have her soft or powerful variants seen in her japanese voicebank… but i can’t help but love her. she was
            the first english voicebank i used when first trying out openutau, and her simplicity and cute voice made
            her so fun to use. so she’s very special to me! maybe she could be special for you too?<br>

            <p><b>milk</b></p>
        </div>

        <p>milk’s voice is a bit deeper and stronger than hanami, and she stands out in my small collection
            of favorite databases. she was the second english voicebank i used, so i often use her as a foil for hanami
            whenever i’m covering duets and such. her english database has three pitches and whisper, power, and
            falsetto vocal modes, making her versatility really robust. <br>

        </div>

        <p>rei’s databases are all nintendo-themed and primarily japanese, but her nintendo
            switch-themed english library is my favorite. she has a slight texan accent and bubbly tone, not to mention
            her
            character design being super cute.<br>

        <h2>using openutau</h2>
        <p>a grab-bag of openutau's features and quirks that you gotta learn.</p>

        <h3>phonemizers</h3>
        <p><img src="assets/openutau main menu ui.png" class="picture"
                alt="main menu of openutau. the left box has buttons that let you change the voicebank/singer, the phonemizer, the renderer, the resampler, as well as other features familiar to those who have used a DAW, such as volume and pan sliders and mute/solo buttons.">
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>almost all voicebanks need to have a selected phonemizer to sing properly. phonemizers use a <span class="highlight">built-in
                dictionary</span> to break down lyrical inputs into their <span class="highlight">phonemes</span> to know which samples from a database to
                pull
                from. in classic utau, this phoneme breakdown was entirely manual, and was especially problematic for
                english voicebanks whose letters are not consistently pronounced like in japanese.</li>
            <li>all voicebanks are comprised of <span class="highlight">aliases</span>, which tell the program which samples from the library to pull
                from
                in order to pronounce a given lyric. phonemizers break down lyrical input to its aliases to streamline
                this
                process.</li>
            <li>the standard phonemizer for japanese voicebanks is <span class="highlight">ja vcv</span> (vowel consonant vowel), which is a recording
                method that allows for smooth cross-fades between syllables. if the phonemizer is set to default (which
                is
                ja cv, consonant vowel, a much choppier recording style), most voicebanks will not work and be unable to
                sing</li>
            <li>english voicebanks have multiple generally used phonemizers, but the most basic one to expect from a
                robust
                database is <span class="highlight">en vccv</span>. this recording style labels phonemes very… interestingly. other voicebanks, like
                milk,
                use <span class="highlight">arpasing</span>, which labels its phonemes using arpabet, which is more straightforward to understand, and
                is
                even a system seen in commercial vocal synth products like synthesizer v.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>phoneme editing</h3>
        <p><img src="assets/openutau phonemes.png" class="picture"
                alt="phoneme view of openutau. the phoneme aliases are in arpabet with labels indicating which pitch the original sample is in. the phonemes are represented by blue trapezoids that overlap each other.">
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>these blue trapezoids in the editor view visualize the phonemes used to have your voicebank sing lyrics
                (if
                they’re not there, it’s likely that an incorrect phonemizer was chosen, or the lyrics are not written in
                a
                way that openutau can recognize). the different nodes can be shifted to adjust the timing and length of
                consonants and vowels, and the boxes can be used to directly edit the phonemes themselves (great for
                adjusting pronunciation nuances for certain words).</li>
            <li>phonemes can be edited to have certain modifications, depending on the samples packaged with your given
                voicebank. for example, gekiyaku’s voicebanks come with <span class="highlight">falsetto</span> samples (only for her highest pitch)
                which
                can be enabled by attaching an F to the phoneme alias. milk has <span class="highlight">vocal fry</span> samples for certain vowels,
                which
                can be enabled with an underscore either before or after the letter, depending on the timing.</li>
            <li><img src="assets/openutau vocal fry.png" class="picture"
                    alt="a phoneme edited to have vocal fry (underscore) on a vowel in the a3 pitch. the edited phoneme is in bold in the phoneme view"><br>bold
                phoneme aliases indicate that they have been edited from the default; can be undone with right click.
            </li>
            <li>the extra features of your voicebank can be learned by reading the attached readme file (though some
                text
                files in japanese will need to be <a
                    href="https://localizely.com/text-encoding-converter/">converted</a> from shift-jis to utf-8;
                without it, the words will
                appear as jumbled characters)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>expressions and resamplers</h3>
        <p><img src="assets/openutau expressions.png" class="picture"
                alt="a large vertical menu of sliders on the right side, which modify the selected note(s) in various ways. they can also be edited with sliders at the bottom of the screen">
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>notes and phonemes can be edited using <span class="highlight">flags</span>, which alter the sample in some way. some can be as simple
                as
                raising the volume of the note to manipulating the rendering to make the voice sound breathy and hoarse.
                certain expressions are exclusive to certain <span class="highlight">resamplers</span>, which enable the voicebank to sing, and can be
                selected with the gear icon in the main menu.</li>
            <li>there are many resamplers to choose from, and certain voicebanks were recorded with the nuances of
                certain
                resamplers in mind. my favorite “default” resampler that i use is <span class="highlight">moresampler</span> since it comes with a lot
                of
                different expression flags that transform the voice. another resampler that i like is tips.exe, which
                has
                less expression flag options but is fast to render.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>tips and tricks for the piano roll</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>certain english words with different pronunciations (read, wind, live, etc.) can have a 1 typed next to
                them
                to automatically render the alternative pronunciation. “wind” by default will be pronounced with a long
                i
                (like “wind-up toy”), while <span class="highlight">wind1</span> will be pronounced with a short i (like the breeze) without the need
                for
                any individual phoneme editing</li>
            <li>if you want to have a lyric pronounced a certain way, you can type the individual phonemes in the note
                itself within <span class="highlight">brackets</span>. the phonemes will depend on which phonemizer/alias style you’re using (mainly
                affects english). you could also use homophones, but this method is most reliable.</li>

            <li>you can use a + to break a word up by syllable, and a +~ or +* to break a single syllable across
                multiple
                notes. the latter is helpful for extending a syllable of a word with multiple syllables.</li>

            <li>this might sound stupid, because it is, but for a time i genuinely thought audio mixing was a matter of
                making sure the instrumental wasn’t louder than the vocals. but no, it’s so much more than that. and i
                can’t
                say i know that much about it still…</li>
