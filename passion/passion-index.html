    <h1>things i wish i knew when first using openutau</h1>
    <p>summer, 2024. being a fan of vocaloid music and wanting to try my hand at using the software, the freeware
        alternative utau and its enhanced successor <a href="https://www.openutau.com/" target="_blank">openutau</a>
        made this very accessible. but being a niche software,
        documentation and basic help tips are scattered, and i wished there was a straightforward resource for every
        question i had when first learning the program.</p>
        <p>time to do just that:</p>

        <summary>what is openutau?</summary>
        <p>openutau is a free-to-use open-source <span class="highlight">vocal synthesis software</span>. it is based off of utau ("to sing"), created
            by ameya in 2008, which served as a free alternative to the commercial synth editor vocaloid (ever heard of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank">hatsune miku</a>?). while utau has seen little updates
            since its release, openutau, its unofficial successor,
            opened its first beta in 2021 and streamlined the general user-interface and user-experience to become more
            accessible.

        <summary>what is a vocal synth editor, and what's with all the characters?</summary>
        <p>vocal synthesis editors such as utau, openutau, and vocaloid allow users to input midi sequences and lyrics
            to have voicebanks, which are databases of samples sung by a voice actor or a singer or <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/138808" target="_blank">train engines</a>, sing melodies. since utau is
            open-source, all of the voices are created and distributed for free by a wide internet community with
            varying commercial use licenses. in the majority of cases, these voices are anthropomorphized into their own
            characters, complete with their own names, character designs, backstories, etc. divorced from their original
            voice actor or creator.</p>

    <h2>my favorite voicebanks</h2>
    <p>with openutau's voicebank library being entirely community-made and free to use, there's a massive variety of
        characters to choose from. openutau even has more language support than other commercial synths!<br>
        that said, the songs i gravitate towards when covering songs are usually <span class="highlight">japanese or english</span>, so voicebanks
        recorded in those languages appeal to me. here are some of my favorites:</p>

    <h3>japanese</h3>
    <!--for each character, try to put a small picture of their icon and have it float to the right. aaaa-->
    <ul>
        <li><b>kasane teto:</b> the one and only. her vocals are crunchy, and her english is nowhere near as smooth as
            her fancy commercial database for synthesizer v, but her sound collection is robust enough to create clear
            tracks, not to mention the nostalgic quality of her character and vocals.<br>
            <a href="https://kasaneteto.jp/utau/" target="_blank">download website</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>adachi rei:</b> one of the most endearing and beloved vocal synth characters in the modern era. her
            vocals are <span class="highlight">entirely artificial</span>, being rendered in audacity and modified to sound like syllables. this
            results in vocals that are tinny, robotic, and borderline incomprehensible. and we love her for that! her
            original language of origin is japanese, but there have been some derivative databases made with her sample
            library to support other languages, including many options for english, <a href="https://utau.fandom.com/wiki/Rei_Adachi#Voicebank_distribution">which can be viewed on the utau fandom wiki</a>.<br>
            <a href="https://mechanicalgirl.jp/adachi-rei/" target="_blank">download website</a> (you may also see documentation of
            missile39, her creator, building her irl)
        </li>
        <li><b>gekiyaku:</b> she’s my favorite! gekiyaku has over ten voicebanks with different vocal styles and
            gimmicks; your mileage may vary depending on your needs and preferences, but they’re all high-quality enough
            to be worth trying out and keeping on your computer. her voice is strong and powerful in most of her vocal
            modes, making her great for metal, though her more soft-spoken voice colors lend themselves to other genres
            well. and she’s FREE?! how good is that?<br>
            <a href="https://kurukuru2suuzi.wixsite.com/kuzutokaze/%E3%82%B2%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A4%E3%82%AFdl?lang=en" target="_blank">demo
                page</a> (you will need to agree to the terms of use to access download links for all voicebanks)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>english</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>hoshino hanami:</b> compared to her japanese voicebank, her english voicebank is a bit limited. this is a
            constant for a lot of utau databases since japanese is much easier and beginner-friendly to record and
            configure. she only has one pitch (meaning higher vocal ranges will only distort her samples) and doesn’t
            have her soft or powerful variants seen in her japanese voicebank… but i can’t help but love her. she was
            the first english voicebank i used when first trying out openutau, and her simplicity and cute voice made
            her so fun to use. so she’s very special to me! maybe she could be special for you too?<br>

        </li>
        <li><b>milk:</b> milk’s voice is a bit raspier and deeper than hanami, and she stands out in my small collection
            of favorite databases. she was the second english voicebank i used, so i often use her as a foil for hanami
            whenever i’m covering duets and such. her english database has three pitches and whisper, power, and
            falsetto vocal modes, making her versatility really robust. <br>

        </li>
        <li><b>rei nintone ODYSSEY:</b> rei’s databases are all nintendo-themed and primarily japanese, but her nintendo
            switch-themed english library is my favorite. she has a slight texan accent and bubbly tone, not to mention her
            character design being super cute.<br>

    <h2>using openutau</h2>
    <p>a grab-bag of openutau's features and quirks that you gotta learn.</p>

    <h3>phonemizers</h3>
    <!--put a picture of openutau's phonemizer menu here, or a breakdown of the main menu ui-->
    <ul>
        <li>almost all voicebanks need to have a selected phonemizer to sing properly. phonemizers use a built-in
            dictionary to break down lyrical inputs into their phonemes to know which samples from a database to pull
            from. in classic utau, this phoneme breakdown was entirely manual, and was especially problematic for
            english voicebanks whose letters are not consistently pronounced like in japanese.</li>
        <li>all voicebanks are comprised of aliases, which tell the program which samples from the library to pull from
            in order to pronounce a given lyric. phonemizers break down lyrical input to its aliases to streamline this
            process.</li>
        <li>the standard phonemizer for japanese voicebanks is ja vcv (vowel consonant vowel), which is a recording
            method that allows for smooth cross-fades between syllables. if the phonemizer is set to default (which is
            ja cv, consonant vowel, a much choppier recording style), most voicebanks will not work and be unable to
            sing</li>
        <li>english voicebanks have multiple generally used phonemizers, but the most basic one to expect from a robust
            database is en vccv. this recording style labels phonemes very… interestingly. other voicebanks, like milk,
            use arpasing, which labels its phonemes using arpabet, which is more straightforward to understand, and is
            even a system seen in commercial vocal synth products like synthesizer v.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>phoneme editing</h3>
    <ul>
        <!--put a picture of the phoneme editor with labels here-->
        <li>these blue trapezoids in the editor view visualize the phonemes used to have your voicebank sing lyrics (if
            they’re not there, it’s likely that an incorrect phonemizer was chosen, or the lyrics are not written in a
            way that openutau can recognize). the different nodes can be shifted to adjust the timing and length of
            consonants and vowels, and the boxes can be used to directly edit the phonemes themselves (great for
            adjusting pronunciation nuances for certain words).</li>
        <li>phonemes can be edited to have certain modifications, depending on the samples packaged with your given
            voicebank. for example, gekiyaku’s voicebanks come with falsetto samples (only for her highest pitch) which
            can be enabled by attaching an F to the phoneme alias. milk has vocal fry samples for certain vowels, which
            can be enabled with an underscore either before or after the letter, depending on the timing.</li>
        <li>the extra features of your voicebank can be learned by reading the attached readme file (though some text
            files in japanese will need to be <a href="https://localizely.com/text-encoding-converter/">converted</a> from shift-jis to utf-8; without it, the words will
            appear as jumbled characters)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>expressions and resamplers</h3>
    <ul>
        <!--put a picture of the expression menu here-->
        <li>notes and phonemes can be edited using flags, which alter the sample in some way. some can be as simple as
            raising the volume of the note to manipulating the rendering to make the voice sound breathy and hoarse.
            certain expressions are exclusive to certain resamplers, which enable the voicebank to sing, and can be
            selected with the gear icon in the main menu.</li>
        <li>there are many resamplers to choose from, and certain voicebanks were recorded with the nuances of certain
            resamplers in mind. my favorite “default” resampler that i use is moresampler since it comes with a lot of
            different expression flags that transform the voice. another resampler that i like is tips.exe, which has
            less expression flag options but is fast to render.</li>
        <li> <a href="https://utaforum.net/threads/utau-resampler-directory.538/" target="_blank">resampler directory</a> compiled on
            utauforum</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>tips and tricks for the piano roll</h3>
    <ul>
        <!--put examples of phoneme editing/extensions here-->
        <li>certain english words with different pronunciations (read, wind, live, etc.) can have a 1 typed next to them
            to automatically render the alternative pronunciation. “wind” by default will be pronounced with a long i
            (like “wind-up toy”), while wind1 will be pronounced with a short i (like the breeze) without the need for
            any individual phoneme editing</li>
        <li>if you want to have a lyric pronounced a certain way, you can type the individual phonemes in the note
            itself within brackets. the phonemes will depend on which phonemizer/alias style you’re using (mainly
            affects english). you could also use homonyms, but this method is most reliable.</li>

            href="https://arpasing.tubs.wtf/en/resources/phoneme-chart" target="_blank">arpabet phoneme list</a>
        <li>you can use a + to break a word up by syllable, and a +~ or +* to break a single syllable across multiple
            notes. the latter is helpful for extending a syllable of a word with multiple syllables.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="block">
    <h2>mixing the vocals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>i’m gently going to tell past me, wide-eyed at finally being able to make my own vocal synth covers after
            being a long-time admirer of the community… you need to mix your covers, dawg</li>
        <li>this might sound stupid, because it is, but for a time i genuinely thought audio mixing was a matter of
            making sure the instrumental wasn’t louder than the vocals. but no, it’s so much more than that. and i can’t
            say i know that much about it still…</li>
        <li>two resources i unquestioningly still refer to are two youtube videos on audio mixing specifically for
            vocaloid music. <a href="https://youtu.be/IpWddN1wQV0?si=Noa-I4x6yudCotjA" target="_blank">guitarheropandazero's video</a>
            is more straightforward, whereas <a href="https://youtu.be/IgzRIZokcZA?si=uV-vd0ie5uT_RbJK" target="_blank">joezcafe’s
                video</a> goes in depth on
            what each setting does.</li>

    <h2>i wanna make my own voicebank, but it looks really hard</h2>
    <p>making your own vocal database is no walk in the park, especially if you want it to be as usable as commercial voicebanks or even high-fidelity utau banks, but for your first time, just have fun and focus on the novelty of it all. there are several resources and tools that make voicebank creation seem not so difficult!</p>
